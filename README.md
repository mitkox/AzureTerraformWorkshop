About this Workshop
========
This is a Workshop for *Terraform on Azure*.

Infrastructure as Code allows the management of your infrastructure including networks, virtual machines, platform services, and load balancers. Using Terraform configuration to describe the desired Azure resources needed for an environment ensures that consistent infrastructure is created each time it is deployed.

This Workshop is focused on:

- Understanding Infrastructure as Code concepts
- Terraform as an Infrastructure as Code provider for Azure
- Integrating Terraform on Azure DevOps tooling.

Attendees will learn basics of Infrastructure as Code  and gain skills on deploying and managing Azure resources using Terraform.

Practical examples in this workshop include the creation of some basic Azure Resouces, however many others can be deployed using available Terraform resources.

###  Target audience

* Sysadmins
